## Project Overview

In this project, I must animate lyrics from the video. The lyrics from the music is meant to represent the idea of community, like where people with similar interest join together, or people join together to reach a similar goal.

The song I've gotten the lyrics from are from are Scatman John's famous tracks, "Scatman's World". The song has a focus on making a community, peacefully living togther. 


## Technical Overview

In this project, I utilize the "Visual Studio Code" software to create the animations. The files on this project mostly used a mix of HTML and CSS (mostly CSS). Each page has their own separate HTML file, while many of them share one or more CSS file to help with the styling an animations.

Each CSS file has each element have their positioning into absolute [to allow the elements to not affect the pages other elements,vwhile also have custom placement], while using the various CSS code, like "left", "top", and/or "bottom", to position the text.

From my lessons on typography, I utilize the font sizes, weight, and color to have the priority of attention be placed upon them. To allow the viewer to view the text that links to the other pages, I have the text significantly larger than the other text, while using the custom "Micro 5" typeface from Google Fonts. 

The linked text uses various means to make itself stand out. The color can be different from the other texts' "black" or "white".  The text would also glow (using "text-shadow") and some even has a small, translucent reflection below them (using "-webkit-box-reflect" for this effect) to mimic the glowing text floating over a body of water.
